OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Open, P is for Posts scratchin' temple
The last P... well... that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to keep your posts updated
It's stock post features that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
